# doc-auth

Example [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) DApp that allows the deployer to act as a certificate authority by signing hashes using their Ethereum account.

There are two use-cases for the contract.

1. Users can load the web-page (locally) and check if a hash is signed by the authority account, or simply load it into the Mist browser and check from there.

2. The contract can be called from other contracts; for example to validate input, contract bytecode, or other on-chain data.

### The smart contract

The [SingleSignerAuthority contract](https://github.com/androlo/doc-auth/blob/master/contracts/src/SingleSignerAuthority.sol) is a simple registry for `[bytes32 => uint]` pairs, where the bytes can be anything and the `uint` is a timestamp. Usually the bytes would be a SHA3-256 hash of something like a document, or a binary file.

The only write-operation that is allowed is `sign`, which takes a `bytes32` param and maps it to the current block time. This can only be done by one account; hence the name `SingleSignerAuthority`.

The address of the authority is the address of the account that created the contract, and is recorded automatically when the contract is deployed. The authority cannot be changed.

### Running the demo

To run the demo you need to have a running public chain node, and know how to interact with it. Instructions on how to set up an Ethereum node can be found on the Ethereum project page, and on the official page of the most popular Ethereum client [geth](http://ethereum.github.io/go-ethereum/).

When the Ethereum node is running (and answering to RPC calls), just start `www/index.html` in a web-browser. Near the bottom of the page you will find several examples of documents and their hashes that you can paste into the hash field and `check`.

The web-page points to an Ethereum contract deployed by me, which means I am the only one allowed to sign hashes (i.e. I am the Authority). The contract is an instance of `SingleSignerAuthority` (which can be found in the `contracts` folder), and is deployed on the public chain.

##### Troubleshooting

If the page fails to load, you will get an alert. If the alert says that the RPC server does not respond, make sure that:

- Ethereum is running, and answers to RPC calls on the correct address and port. You can change the address and port at line 8 of `www/scripts/index.js`.

- CORS is set (with `geth` you could add `--rpccorsdomain "*"` to check if this is the issue).

If the page says that contract data can't be read, make sure that:

- the Ethereum node is running the public chain.

### Create a new SingleSignerAuthority

To create Your own authority You need to do this:

1. Deploy a new instance of `SingleSignerAuthority`. This can be done from the [Mist wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/mist), for example. The bytecode and ABI can be found in `contracts/build`. It does not matter if you add it to the public chain (Homestead), the test-chain (Morden), or a local dev-chain.

2. Open `www/scripts/index.js` and change the `contractAddress` variable (line 7) to the new address.

3. Run the webpage.

##### Troubleshooting

In addition to the RPC alert, you may now also get an alert that says the contract can't be read. In that case make sure that you updated the `index.js` file with the new contract address.

If there is no blue `sign` button below the hash field, make sure that the current `coinbase` address is the same as the one used when deploying the contract.

### Testing the contract (node.js)

Contract tests are done using [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) against an [ethereumjs-testrpc]((https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc)) server. This is how you run them:

1. Make sure `node.js` and `npm` is on your path.

**NOTE** To run `testrpc` on Windows you need to do some additional preparation. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc/wiki/Installing-TestRPC-on-Windows). If you don't intend on using testrpc, this is probably not worth the effort.

2. cd into the project root and type `npm install`. This will install testrpc locally.

3. cd into the `testserver` folder and run `testserver.js`. Wait for it to print `Ethereum test RPC server listening on port 8545`.

4. Start `www/contract_test.html` in a web-browser.

### Hacking

If you want to edit the smart-contract you need to know how to code in Solidity. The Solidity project page can be found [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

A simple way to add more features to the contract is to copy the code from `contracts/src/SingleSignerAuthority.sol` into the [Online Solidity Compiler](https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/). It has syntax highlighting and does real-time error checking, and even allow you to deploy the contract onto a simulated chain and interact with it - although the output is not formatted so it may be a bit hard to read. Either way, when you are happy with the edits you can just get the bytecode and ABI (interface) from the online compiler and put it into Mist (or whatever you want to use for deploying and interacting with the contract on-chain).
